## VueFriends
---
VueFriends is a project that is based on tutorial project called *Robofriends* from Andrei Neagoie's Udemy course, *[The Complete Web Developer in 2019: Zero to Mastery](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery/)*. It's a wonderful course and I highly recommend it! 

The original project was created using React, and utlizes the [Robohash](https://robohash.org/) and [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) APIs to create a series of contact cards with unique robot avatars for a sample list of contacts/friends. The purpose of the tutorial project was to introduce students to component-based web development using the React framework.  

In an effort to learn something new and to push myself as a web developer, I decided to recreate this project using Vue instead of React. I was curious how the two would compare both from a learning standpoint as well as use standpoint. Additionally, I wanted to add some features that were not part of the original project which include:
- An option for the user to select which type of avatar to use for the contacts, as the Robohash API provides options for multiple including:
  - Robots
  - Monsters
  - Robot Heads
  - Cats
- An option to click on the contact card and display more information such as:
  - Username 
  - Phone Number
  - Address
  - Website
- The option and functionallity of adding a new contact and card to the list

### Enjoy!
