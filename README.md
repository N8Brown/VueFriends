## RoboFriends Plus
---
Robofriends is project that originates from Andrei Neagoie's Udemy course, *[The Complete Web Developer in 2019: Zero to Mastery](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery/)*. It's a wonderful course and I highly recommend it! 

The project was originally created using React, and it utlizes the [Robohash](https://robohash.org/) and [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) APIs to create a series of contact cards with unique avatars for a sample list of contacts/friends. 

I have to decided to recreate this project using Vue instead of React as a way to see how the two frameworks compare. Additionally, I wanted to add some features that were not part of the original project:
- An option for the user to select which type of avatar to use for the contacts, as the Robohash API provides options for multiple including:
  - Robots
  - Monsters
  - Robot Heads
  - Cats
- An option to click on the contact card and display more information such as:
  - Phone Number
  - Address
  - Company
###Enjoy!
